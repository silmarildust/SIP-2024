###Plots
1. Surge factor over time (split by route or destination) - DONE
2. Surge factor vs travel distance (to confirm correlation, and not travel time because price and therefore surge factor is determined beforehand)
3. Published fare vs ETA and ETT (to check if their payment model still is reasonable even with surges)
4. Surge factor split by surge notice (dichotomous)
