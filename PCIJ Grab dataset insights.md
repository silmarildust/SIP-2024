Unfortunately, the actual locations where data was measured cannot be visualized using geopandas because coordinates were not provided, likely for the safety of the researchers. However, this is information that would be useful to have.

## Jamovi insights

The report by PJIC revealed that "Customers still often had long wait times even when surge rates applied". From this, it makes sense to check the correlation between the ETA (estimated time waiting for the ride) and the published fare of the ride. When a correlation analysis was done using Jamovi, it was revealed that the two variables have a fair negative correlation (according to Chan's (2003) interpretation, r = -0.0388).
